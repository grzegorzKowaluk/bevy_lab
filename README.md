# Bevy lab - private learning project

The only purpose of making this project public is to document my Rust + Bevy journey.
The README file is organized in a journal-style format, where I write something about each developed app.

My goal is to make simple projects and not focus on refactoring for now. I'll try to not use AI agents.

Throughout this journey, my main source of information about the engine will be https://taintedcoders.com/.
